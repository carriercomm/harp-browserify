===============

A harp boilerplate with browserify support.

How to
===============

```
harp init -b kevinsimper/harp-browserify
```

then do

```
npm install
npm start
```

which will start a harp server and a browserify watcher. You can look at the package.json to see how.

This method with using npm commands allows for greater flexibility on how you want to structure your project.

Also you don't need to install anything global, because npm will automaticly look in the `node_modules` folder.
